I look like I'm 9 months pregnant no joke! It made my belly balloon out like I have beer gut and I don't drink beer. I feel like my whole body is swollen.

Im also lactose intolerant and was prescribed calcium supplements. And my family has lots of history of breadt cancer and osteoporosis. During the shots i had no weight gain however, i actually lost about 20 pounds a year after. I lost my boobs too unfortunately lol. I was lazy and had no desire to do anything most of the time. i was also extremely moody and had bad ups and downs. Since getting off the shots my boobs hurt all the time, i’m constantly hungry, and have horrible fatigue. I get annoyed easily. My period is all over the place. I bleed probably once a week right now and its honestly horrible. It makes me worried that i’ll never be normal again. I wouldnt ever recommend this form of birth control to someone for an irregular period, especially as young as i was. If i had known about all the side effects i would have never got on the shot.\n"

      "I started Depo when I was 13 years old. Im now 19 and just stopped the shots in September 2018. I was diagnosed with depression prior to starting the shot. Im also lactose intolerant and was prescribed calcium supplements. And my family has lots of history of breadt cancer and osteoporosis. During the shots i had no weight gain however, i actually lost about 20 pounds a year after. I lost my boobs too unfortunately lol. I was lazy and had no desire to do anything most of the time. i was also extremely moody and had bad ups and downs. Since getting off the shots my boobs hurt all the time, i’m constantly hungry, and have horrible fatigue. I get annoyed easily. My period is all over the place. I bleed probably once a week right now and its honestly horrible. It makes me worried that i’ll never be normal again. I wouldnt ever recommend this form of birth control to someone for an irregular period, especially as young as i was. If i had known about all the side effects i would have never got on the shot.\n"
